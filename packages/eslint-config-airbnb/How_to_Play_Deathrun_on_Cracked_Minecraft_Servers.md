If you want to play Deathrun on cracked Minecraft servers, you need to find a server that supports this minigame and allows cracked clients. Cracked clients are versions of Minecraft that do not require a premium account to play. Some servers allow cracked clients to join, but they may have some limitations or risks, such as hackers, griefers or lag.
 
One way to find cracked Minecraft servers that have Deathrun is to use a server list website, such as [mclike.com](https://mclike.com/minecraft-servers-deathrun), [servers-minecraft.com](https://servers-minecraft.com/deathrun-servers) or [minecraftiplist.com](https://www.minecraftiplist.com/server-tags/DeathRun). These websites show you the IP addresses, versions, players, votes and descriptions of various servers. You can filter by tags, such as Deathrun, Cracked or Minigames, to find servers that match your preferences.
 
Another way to find cracked Minecraft servers that have Deathrun is to use Reddit, such as [r/TLAUNCHER](https://www.reddit.com/r/TLAUNCHER/comments/lxg0fs/cracked_deathrun_server/). This subreddit is for users of TLauncher, a cracked Minecraft launcher that lets you play with any version and mod. You can ask for server recommendations or browse through posts from other users who share their favorite servers.
 
Once you find a cracked Minecraft server that has Deathrun, you need to join it using your cracked client. Make sure you have the same version as the server and follow any instructions or rules that the server may have. Then, you can select Deathrun from the minigame menu and start playing. Have fun and good luck!
  
## Tips for Playing Deathrun on Minecraft
 
Deathrun is a fun and challenging minigame, but it can also be frustrating if you keep dying or losing. Here are some tips to help you improve your skills and enjoy the game more.
 
- As a runner, you need to be fast and agile. Practice your parkour skills on different maps and learn how to jump, sprint, crouch and strafe. You can also use items like speed potions, ender pearls or elytra to boost your mobility.
- As a killer, you need to be strategic and cunning. Observe the runners' movements and patterns and try to predict their next move. Use your traps wisely and don't waste them on empty spaces or easy obstacles. You can also use items like fireballs, arrows or snowballs to damage or slow down the runners.
- As a team player, you need to communicate and cooperate with your teammates. Use chat or voice chat to share information, warn each other of traps or dangers, or coordinate your actions. You can also help each other by distracting the killer, boosting each other's jumps or reviving each other.
